# Snake Game

This is an example implementation of a classic Snake game in Python using the Pygame library.

## Objective of the Game 
- Control the snake and try to eat the food.
- As the snake eats each food item, it grows longer and moves faster.
- Aim to survive as long as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area.

## Installation

1.Download and install the latest version of Python 3 from here.

2.Install the required Pygame library by running the following command:

    
    pip install pygame

3.Download or copy the files of this project to your computer.

## How to Play

1.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

2.To start the game, run the following command:



    python snake_game.py

3.Once the game starts, the snake will begin to move automatically.

4.Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.

5.The snake will grow longer and increase its score each time it eats food.

6.Be careful not to collide with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area.

7.The game ends when the snake collides, and your score will be displayed.

8.You can restart the game automatically after it ends.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
